Week 1 Descriptive Statistics
1 Descriptive Statistics: Measurement, Location
and Dispersion
1.1 Nominal/Categorical, Ordinal and Interval Scales
Data is central to statistics. A common reply to the question “what is data” is that it is
“numbers to do with something”. Whilst this is not strictly true, usually data is in the
form of numbers. It is therefore important to consider the nature of the numbers being
used in any particular set of data, as we see in this section, the number “3” for example
is not always the same.
1.2 Nominal/Categorical scale
At the nominal scale, i.e., for a nominal category, one uses labels; for example, people
may be male or female, rocks can be generally categorized as igneous, sedimentary and
metamorphic. Often numbers are used to code nominal variables, for example: male =1,
female=2; igneous, =1, sedimentary=2, metamorphic=3. What is important is that the
numbers are being used as labels, they are not quantities of any kind. For instance, if you
had one igneous rock (= 1) and one metamorphic rock (= 3), clearly it makes no sense
to say that as 1+3 = 2, “on average” you have a sedimentary rock! Variables assessed on
2
a nominal scale are also called categorical variables.
1.3 Ordinal scale
In this scale type, the numbers assigned to objects or events represent the rank order
(1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.) of the entities assessed, but do not describe quantity. An example of
ordinal measurement is when a book is ranked 1 star, 2 star etc. If some one ranks one
book "1 star" and another "3 star" the person certainly thinks the second book is better
than the first, but not necessarily three times as good.
1.4 Interval/Quantitative scale
Quantitative (i.e. those that express quantity) attributes are all measurable on interval
scales, as any difference between the levels of an attribute can be multiplied by any real
1
variables that number to exceed or equal another difference. Thus height, weight, tem-
perature, distance, family size, age are all measured on the interval scale. It is important
to be aware of differences that exist between interval scale variables. For instance, if
you were 30cms long when you were born, and are 180cms tall now, then you have been
every single height between 30cms and 180cms at some stage in you life, i.e. there was a
time you were 111.1cms tall, a time you were 10πcms tall etc. If you consider family size
(which we shall take to mean how many brothers and sisters you have, plus yourself) this
is still a quantity, but is different to height in as far as, for instance, say you are the eldest
of six children, when you were born your family size was one, when your next sibling was
born the family size “jumped” to two, it then moved to three, four etc. but there was
never a time when your family size was 32. We may therefore subdivide interval data
9
into continuous and discrete data.
1.4.1 Continuous Data
Interval data is said to be continuous if the values belonging to it may take on any value
within a finite or infinite interval. You can count, order and measure continuous data.
1.4.2 Discrete Data
Interval data is said to be discrete if the values belonging to it are distinct and separate,
i.e. they can be counted (1,2,3,...). Examples might include the number of kittens in
a litter; the number of patients in a doctor’s surgery; the number of flaws in one metre
of cloth. Note that it is not necessarily true that discrete data can only take on integer
values, if data could only take values 3, 31, 31, 33 and 4, and these were measurements
4 2 4
of some sort, then this would be discrete data. The distinguishing feature is that there
are “gaps” between any two possible values.
2 Measures of Central Tendency (“Averages”)
The purpose of descriptive statistics is to describe data. If we were to ask people to
describe the age of a certain group of people we would hear statements such as:
• On average they are twenty.
• Half of them are over twenty-one.
• More of them are eighteen than any other age.
These three descriptions correspond to the three most common measures of central
tendency, the mean, median and mode.
2.1 Mean
The mean (or, more correctly, the arithmetic mean) of n numbers x ,x ,...,x is given
1 2 n
by the formula:
2
(cid:80) (cid:80)
x x
i i
µ = or x¯ =
n n
where
• µ = mean of a population.
• x¯ =mean of a sample.
In layperson’s language: we add up all the numbers and divide them by the number of
numbers that we have.
Example
The mean of {1,3,6,2} is:
1+3+6+2
= 3
4
Mean
2.2 Median ... “The one in the middle”
To calculate the median of a set of data we:
• Order the data. (either from biggest to smallest or vice-versa, it does not matter).
• Find the item of data above which half the data lies, (and hence below which half
the data lies).
Example
Find the median of {2,7,3,1,0,4,2}
Solution
↓
• Order the data: 0,1,2,2,3,4,7
• Clearly half the data lies above 2 and half below it.
Hence the median = 2.
The above only works if there is an odd number of numbers in the set being considered.
If there is an even number we take the mean of the two numbers in the middle.
3
Example
Find the median of 2,7,3,0,1,0,1,5 =?
Solution
↓ ↓
1. Order the data: 0,0,1,1,2,3,5,7
2. Median = 1+2 = 3 or 1.5
2 2
Note that half the data lies above 1.5 and half below 1.5
Note that if there are n items of data in the set being considered then the median is the
n+1
item of data in position (after ordering).
2
2.3 Mode
The mode of a set of data is the data value that occurs most frequently.
Example
The mode of: {0,1,3,2,2,1,0,2} is 2.
Example
The mode of: {0,0,1001,1002,1003,1004,1006,1007, 1008,1009,1010} is 0.
If two observations are equally frequent we say that the data is bimodal. If no data
value occurs (at least) twice then the data does not have a mode. Remember that the
mode is an attempt (as are the mean and median) to use one number to describe a whole
set of data. Often the mode does not succeed very well at this task. For instance if I
were to ask any group of people how many units of alcohol they drank in the last week,
the mode will almost certainly be zero, as more people will not have drunk at all than
will have drunk any given positive number of units.
3 Other measures of Location
3.1 The Maximum and Minimum
These are self explanatory, and simply represent the greatest and least data values.
3.2 Q and Q , The Upper and Lower Quartiles
1 3
The Lower Quartile may be roughly defined as the value that is a “quarter of the way
up” the data. Again, different people have slightly different ways of determining exactly
what this value is; usually however all methods lead to approximately the same answer.
We shall use the definition that the lower quartile is the item in n+1 position. Similarly
4
4
the upper quartile may be roughly defined as the value that is a “three quarters of the
way up” the data. We shall use the definition that the upper quartile is the item in
3(n+1) position. Note that the upper quartile is sometimes denoted by Q , and the lower
4 3
quartile by Q , Q being the median.
1 2
Example
Find the median and upper and lower quartiles of {1,4,2,−2,8,10,3,6,3}
Solution:
↓
• Order the data from lowest to highest: {−2,1,2,3,3,4,6,8,10}
• Here n = 9, so:
• the median position is the data value in 9+1 = 5th position, i.e. 3.
2
• the lower quartile (Q ) is the data value in 9+1 = 2.5th position, i.e. 1.5.
1 4
• the upper quartile (Q ) is the data value in 30 = 7.5th position, i.e. 7.0.
3 4
Example
Find the median, upper and lower quartiles of:
5 11 7 8 3 11 8 10 9 7 5 5
6 11 6 6 10 8 14 13 6 5 8 2
Solution:
• Sort the data:
2 3 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 7 7
8 8 8 8 9 10 10 11 11 11 13 14
• Here n = 24, so the median position is 24+1 = 12.5th position, i.e. 7.5
2
• The lower quartile (Q ) is the data value in 24+1 = 6.25th position, i.e. a
1 4
quarter of the way between the 6th and 7th items of data, i.e. 5.25.
• The upper quartile (Q ) is the data value in 3(24+1) = 18.75th position, i.e. a
3 4
three-quarters of the way between the 18th and 19th items of data, i.e. 10.00.
NotethatotherapproachestofindingQ andQ mayresultinslightlydifferentvalues.

4 The Five Number Summary
5
The Five Number Summary consists of the minimum, lower quartile, median, upper
quartile and maximum of a set of data. i.e.
{Min, Q , Median, Q , Max}
1 3
These five statistics taken together will give a better description of the data than any
one of them on its own. For example, the five number summary for the data
5 11 7 8 3 11 8 10 9 7 5 5
6 11 6 6 10 8 14 13 6 5 8 2
presented previously is:
{2,5.25,7.5,10,14}
5 Measures of Spread/Dispersion
Without knowing something about how data is dispersed, measures of central tendency
may be misleading. For example, a residential street with 20 homes on it having a mean
value of £200,000 with little variation from the mean would be very different from a
street with the same mean home value but with 3 homes having a value of 1 million and
the other 17 clustered around £60,000. Measures of dispersion provide a more complete
picture. Dispersion measures include the range, mean absolute deviation, interquartile
range, varianceandstandarddeviation. Measuresofdispersionarealsosometimesknown
as measures of spread.
5.1 The Range
Probablythesimplestmeasureofdispersionistherange. Itiscalculatedbysimplytaking
the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data set.
Example
For example, if D = {4,5,2,4,6,6,10,8,4,6,7,6}, then
Range(D) = 10−2 = 8
The range only provides information about the maximum and minimum values and
does not say anything about the values in between. It is however easy to calculate, and
widely used. Note that it is very sensitive extreme values. For instance if we add a single
additional entry of 100 to D in the example above, then the range increases to 98.
6
5.2 The Interquartile Range
The interquartile range (IQR) of data Y is simply the difference between the upper and
lower quartiles of Y, i.e.
IQR = Q −Q
3 1
As the values of the largest and smallest observations are not involved in its calcu-
lation, it is not influenced by extreme data values. It is the range of the “middle half”
of the data, and hence is a very useful measure of dispersion if one is interested only in
“typical cases”.
5.3 Variance and Standard Deviation
The most commonly used measure of dispersion is the standard deviation, which is the
square root of the variance. The variance of a data set is calculated by taking the mean
of the squared differences between each value and the mean value. The calculation and
notation of the variance and standard deviation depends on whether we are considering
the entire population or a sample set. Following the general convention of using Greek
characters to express population parameters and Arabic characters to express sample
statistics, the notation for standard deviation and variance is as follows:
• population standard deviation = σ
• population variance = σ2
• estimate of population standard deviation based on sampled data = s
• estimate of population variance based on sampled data = s2
The population variance of data {x ,x ,...,x } is defined as:
1 2 n
(cid:80) (x −µ)2
σ2 = i
n
where µ is the mean of the data.
The population standard deviation is the square root of this value, i.e.
(cid:114)(cid:80)
(x −µ)2
i
σ =
n
7
The variance of a sampled subset of observations is calculated in a similar manner,
using the appropriate notation for sample mean and number of observations.
Example
The ages of the four children in a pediatric ward are 4, 5, 7 and 8. What is the
variance of these ages?
Solution:
Here
4+5+7+8
• µ = = 6.
4
(4−6)2 +(5−6)2 +(7−6)2 +(8−6)2 4+1+1+4
• σ2 = = = 2.5.

6 Graphical Techniques
In this section we discuss several types of graphs and diagram that are used to represent
data. There are numerous graphical techniques and we will only discuss a few of them
here.
6.1 Histograms
The most familiar diagram for summarizing data is most probably the histogram. The
term was introduced by Karl Pearson in 1895.
8
Example
The frequency table below records the heights of 11,327 males living in a fictional
town.
Height x (cm) Frequency
151 ≤ x < 154 4
154 ≤ x < 157 17
157 ≤ x < 160 79
160 ≤ x < 163 229
163 ≤ x < 166 545
166 ≤ x < 169 1009
169 ≤ x < 172 1615
172 ≤ x < 175 2064
175 ≤ x < 178 2043
178 ≤ x < 181 1656
181 ≤ x < 184 1110
184 ≤ x < 187 571
187 ≤ x < 190 259
190 ≤ x < 193 94
193 ≤ x < 196 25
196 ≤ x < 199 5
199 ≤ x < 203 1
The data is shown in the histogram below
Figure 1: Histogram of Heights
9
A common misconception exists regarding the purpose of a histogram. Whilst it is
certainly possible to measure the height of the bar representing the interval 169–172 and
determine that there are 1,615, or 3.64%, of men in this height range, that is not the
principal purpose of the histogram. The principal purpose of the histogram is to give a
quick visual impression of the data. We see at a glance that the most common height is
in-or-about 175cms, and that the heights fall off evenly either side of this. (Later in the
course we shall see that this corresponds to what is known as a normal distribution.)
6.2 Stem and Leaf Plot
Stem and leaf plots may be regarded as a variation of a histogram that maintains the
principal purpose of a histogram in that they provide a quick visual impression of the
distribution of the data, but in addition enable the data itself to be retrieved from the
plot. They are however only useful if there is not “too much” data. Usually stem and leaf
plots are only used with “count data”, i.e. data that are whole numbers, but they may
be used if it is permissible to round numbers to the nearest integer.
10
Example
Consider the following dataset on the number of rooms in a hotel occupied each
day during the month of June.
55 49 37 57 46 40 64 35 73 62
61 43 72 48 54 69 45 78 46 59
40 58 56 52 49 42 62 53 46 81
The following histogram represents this data.
Figure 2: Histogram of Room Occupancy
Whilst the histogram rapidly and accurately shows that the data is skewed to the
right, i.e. the right hand tail of the data is longer than the left, (more about this later in
the course), and we can retrieve the information that their were eight days when between
50 and 60 rooms were occupied, we lose, for example, the information that there was only
one day when 56 rooms were occupied.
11
Example
A stem and leaf diagram for the data, with stem unit = 10, is as below:
3 5 7
4 0 0 2 3 5 6 6 6 8 9 9
5 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
6 1 2 2 4 9
7 2 3 8
8 1
Table 1: Stem and leaf Plot of Room Occupancy, stem unit = 10
As is apparent, the left-most column represents the intervals 30,40,...,80 with the
quantities within these intervals being represented by the “leaves”. The stem and
leaf plot is like a histogram turned on its side, with the blocks being replaced by
the individual numbers. A stem and leaf diagram for the same data, with stem
unit = 5, is:
3 5 7
4 0 0 2 3
4 5 6 6 6 8 9 9
5 3 3 4
5 5 6 7 8 9
6 1 2 2 4
6 9
7 2 3
7 8
8 1
Table 2: Stem and leaf Plot of Room Occupancy, stem unit = 5
Note that stem-and-leaf diagrams are only practical if the amount of data being
represented is reasonably small.

6.3 Boxplots
A boxplot is a diagram that looks like the below:
Figure 3: Simple Boxplot
Boxplots concentrate on giving a quick visual interpretation of the distribution of the
data utilizing values of the five number summary
{min,Q ,median,Q ,max}
1 3
The steps used in drawing box plots are the following:
• Calculate the median, the upper quartile (Q ) and lower quartile (Q ).
3 1
• Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting the lower quartile from the
upper quartile. i.e. IQR = Q −Q
3 1
• Construct a box parallel to the vertical axis with the upper edge corresponding to
the value of Q and the lower edge to Q .
3 1
• Indicate where the median lies inside of the box by drawing a horizontal line.
• Any data observation which lies more than 1.5×IQR lower than the lower quartile
or 1.5 × IQR higher than the upper quartile is considered an outlier. Indicate
where the smallest value that is not an outlier is by connecting it to the box with
a vertical line or “whisker” and cap this “whisker” with a small horizontal line.
Likewise, connect the largest value that is not an outlier to the box by a “whisker”
and mark it with a small horizontal line.
• Indicate outliers (untypical observations) by a cross/circle.
6.3.1 Multiple Boxplots
Boxplots are particularly useful for comparing the distributions of data that has been
classified into several categories.
13
Figure 4: Multiple Boxplot
Multiple boxplots are sometimes referred to as categorised boxplots. For instance, the
multiple boxplot of Figure 4 might refer to the number of days of sick leave taken by
three categories of workers, A, B and C. We see immediately that
• The range of days of absenteeism is approximately the same for all three categories,
• in general, category B workers take the least number of days off sick, followed by
category A followed by C,
• the variation of the number of days absenteeism is greatest amongst category C
workers, and least for category B.
14
Example
In an experiment the times taken by people to perform a given task is recorded.
The boxplot of Figure 5 illustrates the results of the experiment where the times
have been categorised by age-group. (21−30 etc). Comment upon the results of
the experiment.
Figure 5: Times taken to perform task
15
Example
If left untreated, the median life expectancy from diagnosis of a certain type of
cancer is 20 months. Three drugs to treat this cancer are each tested on 500
patients, and the time (in months) from diagnosis to death is recorded for each
patient. The resultant data are illustrated by the multiple boxplot of Figure 6.
The boxplot labeled “None” illustrates the times-to-death of patients that received
no treatment.

What may we conclude?
